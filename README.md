- ⛩️ Hello everyone, my (nick)name is @ScipioneParmigiano

- I'm a student of _economics_ in Swiss. My main interests are:
    - 📈 **statistics** applied to economics;
    - 🏈 **sport**: I practice calisthenics;
    - 🔖 **latin**: I'm translating Virgil's Aeneid;
    - 💻 **programming**: even if I'm still a rookie I love programming (R and a bit of Python).
