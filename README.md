- ⛩️ Hello everyone, my (nick)name is @ScipioneParmigiano

- I study _economics_ at USI in Lugano (CH), even if I live on lake Como (IT), my main interests are:
    - 📈 **data science** applied in economics;
    - 🏈 **sport**: I practice calisthenics;
    - 🔖 **latin**: I'm translating Virgil Aeneid;
    - 💻 **programming**: even if I'm a rookie I love programming (R and a bit of Python).
   
	 
- In my free time I’m used to study something by my own, currently I'm intrested in _game theory_. 

- I'm looking for an _opportunity_ to collaborate with motivated people and for an _ambitious project_ in order to leave a mark on the planet.
